# 🐳 **DockerClean**  

**A CLI tool to clean all Docker resources (containers, images, volumes, networks, caches) with a single command.**

---

## 📦 **Installation**

To install DockerClean from PyPI, run:

```bash
pip install dockerclean
```

Or, if you're installing locally from the source:

```bash
pip install .
```

---

## 🚀 **Usage**

DockerClean provides a straightforward way to clean up Docker environments.

### **Interactive Mode (with Confirmation)**  
Run the command and confirm the cleanup manually:  

```bash
dockerclean
```

- After running the command, you'll be prompted to confirm the cleanup:  
  ```
  ⚠️ This will delete all Docker data (containers, images, volumes, networks). Are you sure? (yes/no):
  ```
- **Type `yes`** to proceed with the cleanup.  
- **Type `no`** to cancel the operation.

This mode is ideal when you want to review the operation before execution.

### **Non-Interactive Mode (Skip Confirmation)**  
Use the `-y` flag to skip confirmation and immediately perform the cleanup:  

```bash
dockerclean -y
```

### 🐳 **Prerequisite: Running Docker Without `sudo`**

Before using **DockerClean**, ensure Docker commands can be executed **without requiring `sudo` privileges**.  

If Docker commands like `docker ps` or `docker system prune` require `sudo`, follow the official Docker documentation to configure your user permissions:

⚠️ **Important:** Without completing this setup, you’ll need to run `dockerclean` with `sudo`, which may not work seamlessly with the tool.  

**Ensure Docker runs without `sudo` for the best experience with DockerClean! 🚀**

---

## ⚠️ **Warning**

- This tool **will delete all Docker containers, images, volumes, networks, and caches**.
- The operation is **irreversible**. Ensure you have backed up any important data before proceeding.
